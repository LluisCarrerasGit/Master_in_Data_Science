# Master in Data Science
This repository contains some works I've made in the Master in Data Science I'm studying online since 2017, in UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya - Open University from Catalonia). In UOC, the works are called PAC.

The works are from the next subjects:
- Data Mining.
- Introduction to Python.
- Data tipology and life cicle.
- Advanced models in Data Mining.
